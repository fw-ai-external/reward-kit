## Reporting a Vulnerability

The `reward-kit` team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please **do not** create a public GitHub issue. Instead, send an email to the following address:

**conduct@fireworks.ai**

Please include the following details in your report:

*   A clear description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any specific configurations or sample code.
*   The version(s) of `reward-kit` affected.
*   Potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   Any suggested mitigations or fixes, if you have them.

We will endeavor to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and provide an initial assessment or request for more information. We aim to address critical vulnerabilities promptly.

We kindly ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and address it. We will coordinate with you on the public disclosure once a fix is available.

Thank you for helping keep `reward-kit` secure.
