# Base schema for dataset configurations.
# Individual dataset configs (e.g., gsm8k.yaml) should adhere to this structure.
# They are selected by `dataset_config_name` in the main application config (e.g., in convert_dataset.py).

# --- Expected Fields ---

# REQUIRED: A unique name for the dataset configuration.
# This is used for identification and potentially for referencing specific loading logic.
name: ???

# OPTIONAL: A brief description of the dataset.
description: "Provide a description here."

# REQUIRED: Path or identifier for the dataset.
# - For Hugging Face datasets: use the dataset ID (e.g., "gsm8k", "cais/mmlu").
# - For local datasets: this could be a path to a directory, a script, or a specific file.
#   The interpretation depends on the dataset loading logic in `reward_kit.datasets.loader`.
path: ???

# OPTIONAL: Parameters specifically for loading from Hugging Face `datasets.load_dataset()`.
# Common parameters include `name` (for subsets/configurations like "main" in gsm8k or "all" in mmlu),
# `split` (though often handled by `dataset_usage` in main config), `trust_remote_code`.
# Example: {name: "main", trust_remote_code: true}
hf_load_params: null

# REQUIRED: Column mapping.
# This section maps generic roles (used by processing scripts) to the actual column names
# present in the specific dataset.
columns:
  # REQUIRED: The name of the column in the dataset that contains the primary input text
  # (e.g., the question, the prompt, the instance to be evaluated).
  query: ???

  # REQUIRED: The name of the column that contains the ground truth answer, solution, or label.
  answer: ???

  # OPTIONAL: Add other common roles if your dataset processing logic expects them.
  # For example, for multiple-choice questions:
  # choices: null # Name of the column containing a list of choices.
  # id: null      # Name of a unique identifier column for each sample.

# OPTIONAL: Information about available splits in the dataset.
# The values should be the names of the splits as understood by the dataset loader
# (e.g., "train", "test", "validation" for Hugging Face datasets, or specific file names for local data).
# The actual split to be used is typically specified in the main application config (e.g., `dataset_usage.split`).
splits:
  train: null
  test: null
  validation: null

# OPTIONAL: A list of preprocessing steps or transformations to apply to the dataset after loading.
# The interpretation and execution of these steps would be handled by the dataset loading logic.
# Example: ["remove_html_tags", "normalize_whitespace"]
preprocessing_steps: [] # Default to an empty list

# OPTIONAL: A dictionary for any other dataset-specific parameters or metadata.
# This can be used to store information that doesn't fit into the predefined fields
# but might be useful for custom dataset loading or processing logic.
# Scripts can access these via `cfg.dataset_definition.extra_params` (for example).
extra_params: {} # Default to an empty dict
