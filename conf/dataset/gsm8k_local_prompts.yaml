# Configuration for the local GSM8K sample prompt dataset.
# This dataset is expected to be in the format:
# {"id": "...", "user_query": "...", "ground_truth_for_eval": "..."}
defaults:
  - base_dataset # Inherits from the base dataset schema
  - _self_

source_type: "jsonl"

# Path to the local JSONL file containing prompts.
path_or_name: "development/gsm8k_sample.jsonl"

split: "train" # Default split for single JSONL files

description: "Local GSM8K sample prompts (5 examples from test set) for main.py."

# Column mapping for the fields in development/gsm8k_sample.jsonl
# These names must match the keys in the JSONL objects.
column_mapping:
  id: "id"
  user_query: "user_query" # main.py will use this for the user's question
  ground_truth_for_eval: "ground_truth_for_eval" # main.py will use this for evaluation

  # Ensure these standard base_dataset fields are nulled if not directly used
  # or mapped to something relevant from the JSONL if applicable.
  # For this prompt dataset, 'query' and 'ground_truth' from base_dataset aren't directly
  # used by main.py in the same way; it uses 'user_query' and 'ground_truth_for_eval'.
  query: null
  ground_truth: null
