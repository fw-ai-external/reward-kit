# GSM8K dataset with math-specific system prompt for evaluation.
# This derived dataset takes the base GSM8K dataset and adds a system prompt
# for math problem solving, converting it to evaluation format.

defaults:
  - base_derived_dataset
  - _self_

# Reference the base GSM8K dataset
base_dataset: "gsm8k"

# Math-specific system prompt
system_prompt: "Solve the following math problem. Show your work clearly. Put the final numerical answer between <answer> and </answer> tags."

# Convert to evaluation format with user_query and ground_truth_for_eval
output_format: "evaluation_format"

# For testing, limit to a small number of samples
derived_max_samples: 5
