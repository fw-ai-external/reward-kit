# Reward Kit Improvement Plan

This document outlines proposed changes to enhance the usability, clarity, and overall developer/user experience for the Reward Kit library. The focus is on refining documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) and ensuring consistency.

## Approved Action Items

1.  **Unify Reward Result Objects:**
    *   **Issue:** `README.md` uses `RewardOutput` and `MetricRewardOutput`, while `development/CONTRIBUTING.md` (and likely the core library, based on its imports from `models.py`) uses `EvaluateResult` and `MetricResult`. `MetricResult` also includes a `success: bool` field not present in `MetricRewardOutput`'s example.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   Standardize on `EvaluateResult` for the overall output of a reward function and `MetricResult` for individual metrics.
        *   Ensure `MetricResult` consistently includes `score: float`, `reason: str`, and `success: bool` (where applicable).
        *   Update all examples in `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and any other documentation/examples to use these unified types.
        *   Update type hints in examples accordingly (e.g., `-> EvaluateResult`).
    *   **Rationale:** Consistency reduces confusion for users and contributors. `EvaluateResult` is a more generic and descriptive term for an evaluation outcome.
    *   **Detailed Plan & Progress:** [./improvements/01_unify_reward_result_objects.md](./improvements/01_unify_reward_result_objects.md)

2.  **Remove `original_messages` Parameter:**
    *   **Issue:** The `original_messages` parameter is used in some reward functions to provide conversational context separately from the main `messages` list. The new coding format aims to consolidate this by having `ground_truth` serve as the container for such context if it's a list of messages.
    *   **Proposal:** Remove `original_messages` from reward functions, relying on `ground_truth` (when it's a list of messages) or the main `messages` list for necessary context. Update all related code, tests, and documentation.
    *   **Rationale:** Simplifies the reward function API, reduces redundancy, and aligns with the evolving standard of using `ground_truth` as a flexible container for various forms of expected data, including conversational history.
    *   **Detailed Plan & Progress:** [./improvements/02_remove_original_messages.md](./improvements/02_remove_original_messages.md)

## Proposed Action Items

### I. Project-Wide Consistency & Clarity (Continued)

1.  **Clarify "Metric Folder" Structure:**
    *   **Issue:** The term `--metrics-folders "name=./path/to/folder"` is used frequently, but the expected content and structure of this folder (e.g., what files define the metric, how `__init__.py` is used if it's a Python module) isn't explicitly clear in the `README.md`. `CONTRIBUTING.md` mentions `examples/metrics/word_count`.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   In `README.md` (Getting Started/CLI sections) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Reward Function Development), briefly explain what a "metric folder" should contain.
        *   Provide a simple example of a metric file (e.g., `word_count_metric.py`) and how it's structured, especially if it's just a Python file with a `@reward_function` decorated function.
        *   Explain how the `name` in `name=./path/to/folder` is used (e.g., as an identifier in results or configuration).
    *   **Rationale:** Improves usability by making it clear how to structure custom metrics for use with the CLI and deployment.

2.  **API Key Guidance:**
    *   **Issue:** Instructions to set API keys are present, but lack guidance on *where* users obtain these keys.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   In `README.md` (Authentication Setup) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` (Required Environment Variables), add a brief note like: `(obtain your API key from your Fireworks AI account dashboard)`.
    *   **Rationale:** Small addition that significantly helps new users get started.

3.  **Documentation Links:**
    *   **Issue:** Links to "full documentation" or "official documentation" sometimes point to a `.mdx` file or the GitHub repository root.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   If a rendered documentation website exists (e.g., ReadTheDocs, GitHub Pages from the `.mdx` files), all primary documentation links should point to this live site.
        *   If not, links should consistently point to the most relevant Markdown file within the repository (e.g., `docs/documentation_home.mdx` or specific sections in `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
    *   **Rationale:** Provides users with the best and most accessible version of the documentation.

### II. `README.md` Enhancements

Focus: Make the README more user-centric (using the library) and streamlined.

4.  **Refine "Getting Started" Section:**
    *   **Issue:** Placeholder paths like `./path/to/metrics` can be slightly improved. The purpose of `original_messages` and `**kwargs` in simple examples isn't clear.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   For CLI examples, consider using a path relative to the `examples/` directory if that's the primary source of samples, e.g., `--metrics-folders "word_count=./examples/metrics/word_count"`. Or, clearly state that `./path/to/your_metrics_dir` is a placeholder.
        *   In the `informativeness` example:
            *   Update to use `EvaluateResult` and `MetricResult`.
            *   Add a type hint for the return value: `-> EvaluateResult`.
            *   For `original_messages=None` and `**kwargs`: If these are standard parts of the `@reward_function` signature, add a brief comment (e.g., `# original_messages: Optional[List[Message]] = None - for context if needed` and `# **kwargs: Any - for additional parameters passed by the evaluation system`). If not strictly necessary for basic examples, consider omitting them for simplicity in the *very first* example, introducing them later in "Advanced Usage".
            *   The scoring logic `min(word_count / 100, 1.0)` could benefit from a brief comment, e.g., `# Score normalized to 0-1, assuming 100 words is a good target for this example`.
    *   **Rationale:** Improves clarity and makes the first steps smoother.

5.  **Streamline "Development" Section:**
    *   **Issue:** The "Development" section (Type Checking, Running Tests) is brief and largely duplicates content in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   Reduce this section to a minimum.
        *   Add a prominent link to `development/CONTRIBUTING.md` for comprehensive development and contribution guidelines. Example: "For details on setting up a development environment, running tests, type checking, and contributing to Reward Kit, please see our [Contributing Guidelines](development/CONTRIBUTING.md)."
    *   **Rationale:** Keeps README focused on library usage, directing contributors to the dedicated guide.

6.  **CLI Examples Clarity:**
    *   **Issue:** The structure of `--metrics-folders "word_count=./path/to/metrics"` could be briefly explained.
    *   **Proposal:** Add a short note after the first CLI example using it: e.g., "Here, `word_count` is a name you assign to your metric(s) defined in the specified folder."
    *   **Rationale:** Reduces ambiguity for a key CLI argument.

### III. `development/CONTRIBUTING.md` Enhancements

Focus: Improve clarity, reduce redundancy, and ensure examples align with best practices.

8.  **Streamline Setup Sections:**
    *   **Issue:** "Quick Start" and "Development Environment" sections have significant overlap.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   Consider merging them or making "Quick Start" the primary entry point and linking to more detailed subsections within "Development Environment" if necessary.
        *   Ensure the "Quick Start" is truly quick and covers the essentials: clone, venv, install dev dependencies, run tests/linters.
    *   **Rationale:** Improves readability and reduces cognitive load for new contributors.

9.  **Update Reward Function Example (Related to Approved Item 1):**
    *   **Issue:** The example uses `EvaluateResult` and `MetricResult`, which is good. Ensure it remains the canonical example after project-wide unification.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   Verify the example aligns perfectly with the chosen `EvaluateResult` and `MetricResult` structure (including the `success` field in `MetricResult`), as per the outcome of Approved Item 1.
        *   The example uses `from ..typed_interface import reward_function` and `from ..models import Message, EvaluateResult, MetricResult`. This is good for internal consistency.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides a clear and correct template for new reward functions.

10. **Testing Example:**
    *   **Issue:** The test example uses `unittest`, while `pytest` is the recommended tool for running tests. Assertions on a `dict` might not be ideal if `EvaluateResult` is a class.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   Rewrite the test example using `pytest` style (e.g., plain functions, `assert` statements).
        *   If `EvaluateResult` is a class instance (likely, from `models.py`), use attribute access for assertions (e.g., `assert result.score >= 0.0`).
        *   Example:
            ```python
            # tests/test_your_module.py
            from reward_kit.rewards.your_module import your_function
            from reward_kit.models import Message, EvaluateResult # Assuming EvaluateResult is the type

            def test_your_function_basic():
                messages = [
                    {"role": "user", "content": "Test question"},
                    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Test response"}
                ]
                result: EvaluateResult = your_function(messages=messages) # Add type hint for clarity
                assert result is not None
                assert isinstance(result, EvaluateResult) # Or the specific return type
                assert result.score >= 0.0
                assert result.score <= 1.0
                # Add assertions for result.reason and result.metrics as appropriate
            ```
    *   **Rationale:** Aligns examples with tooling and promotes better testing practices.

12. **Clarify `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` & Centralize Auth:**
    *   **Issue:** The comment `# For specific operations` for `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` is vague, and its configuration is limited to environment variables. Authentication logic (e.g., for `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID`) is currently embedded within `reward_kit/evaluation.py`.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   Centralize all Fireworks AI authentication logic into a new dedicated module (e.g., `reward_kit/auth.py`).
        *   This new module should support reading credentials (like `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` and `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID`) with the following priority:
            1.  Environment variables.
            2.  An `auth.ini` configuration file (e.g., located at `~/.config/reward_kit/auth.ini` or a project-local `./.reward_kit_auth.ini`).
        *   Thoroughly investigate and clearly document the specific operations and scenarios that require `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID`.
        *   Refactor `reward_kit/evaluation.py` and any other relevant parts of the codebase to utilize the new centralized authentication module.
        *   Update `README.md` and `development/CONTRIBUTING.md` with comprehensive instructions on authentication setup, detailing the purpose of each variable/setting, configuration methods (env vars, `auth.ini`), and the credential source priority.
    *   **Rationale:** This approach will significantly improve clarity for both users and contributors regarding authentication. It offers more flexible configuration options, centralizes sensitive credential handling for better maintainability, and ensures the purpose of each configuration item is well-understood.
    *   **Detailed Plan & Progress:** [./improvements/03_improve_authentication_configuration.md](./improvements/03_improve_authentication_configuration.md)

13. **Consistency in `black` Commands:**
    *   **Issue:** "Coding Style and Standards" mentions `black reward_kit`. "Contributing Process" step 6 mentions `black reward_kit tests`.
    *   **Proposal:** Use the more comprehensive `black reward_kit tests examples` (if examples should also be formatted) consistently, or clarify (e.g., "Format application code with `black reward_kit` and tests with `black tests`."). A single command `black .` run from the root is often simplest if all Python code should be formatted.
    *   **Rationale:** Avoids minor confusion.

14. **Pre-commit Hooks in Contributing Process:**
    *   **Issue:** `(Once configured) Run pre-commit hooks` can be more direct.
    *   **Proposal:** Change to "Ensure pre-commit hooks pass (they run automatically on commit if installed). You can also run them manually on all files: `pre-commit run --all-files`."
    *   **Rationale:** Clearer instruction.

15. **"Documentation" Section for Contributors:**
    *   **Issue:** "Update relevant files in `docs/`" is general.
    *   **Proposal:** If specific tools (e.g., Sphinx, MkDocs) or a particular workflow (e.g., "MDX files in `docs/` are compiled into our documentation website at [link-to-docs-site]") are used for documentation, briefly mention them.
    *   **Rationale:** Guides contributors on how to update documentation effectively.

### IV. General "Taste" and Usability Considerations

16. **Review `**kwargs` and `original_messages`:**
    *   **Issue:** These parameters appear in function signatures in examples but are often unused.
    *   **Proposal:**
        *   If they are part of a fixed signature that the `@reward_function` decorator or evaluation system expects, add a comment in examples explaining their general purpose, even if unused in that specific example.
        *   If they are truly optional and not always needed, consider omitting them from the most basic "hello world" style examples to reduce initial complexity, introducing them later when their utility can be shown.
    *   **Rationale:** Balances completeness with simplicity for newcomers.

17. **Code Structure Diagram:**
    *   **Action:** Keep the ASCII tree in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; it's helpful. Ensure it stays up-to-date.

### V. Codebase Health & Best Practices Rubrics

### VII. Critical Issues Addressed (Initial Pass - 2025-05-20)

This section summarizes actions taken to address critical issues identified during the initial phase of the repository review. Further work may be needed on these fronts (e.g., fixing new linter/type errors that surface).

1.  **Data Model Documentation Consistency:**
    *   **Action:** Corrected descriptions and examples of `EvaluateResult` and `MetricResult` in key documentation files to align with the unified data model (i.e., `MetricResult` uses `success: bool`, and `EvaluateResult` generally does not have a top-level `is_score_valid` field).
    *   **Files Updated:**
        *   `docs/api_reference/data_models.mdx`
        *   `docs/developer_guide/core_data_types.mdx`
        *   `docs/examples/basic_examples/general_usage.mdx`
        *   `docs/examples/basic_examples/combined_metrics_rewards.mdx` (specifically the return value description for `cosine_scaled_accuracy_length_reward`).
    *   **Impact:** Reduces user confusion and ensures documentation accurately reflects the intended data structures.

2.  **Linter/Formatter Configuration Standardization:**
    *   **Action:** Standardized linter (`flake8`) and formatter (`black`) configurations across `.flake8`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and `Makefile`.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Line length standardized to 88 characters.
        *   `flake8` max complexity set to 15.
        *   Reviewed and reduced `flake8` ignored errors in pre-commit to enable more checks.
        *   Enabled `flake8-docstrings` in pre-commit.
        *   Updated `Makefile` targets (`lint`, `format`, `typecheck`) to cover more project directories (`reward_kit`, `tests`, `examples`, `scripts`).
    *   **Impact:** Promotes consistent code style, improves code quality through stricter linting, and ensures development tools behave more uniformly. New linting/formatting issues may now be reported.

3.  **Outdated `CHANGELOG.md`:**
    *   **Action:** Added a prominent note to `CHANGELOG.md` highlighting that versions `0.2.5` through `0.2.11` are undocumented and require manual backfilling by reviewing git history.
    *   **Impact:** Clearly flags the missing information and prompts maintainers to update the changelog for better release tracking.

4.  **Highly Permissive `mypy.ini`:**
    *   **Action:** Modified `mypy.ini` to re-enable several important type checking error codes by removing them from the `disable_error_code` list. Kept `import-not-found`, `truthy-function`, and `misc` disabled for now.
    *   **Impact:** Strengthens static type checking. This change is expected to reveal new type errors in the codebase that will need to be addressed by fixing type hints/code or adding specific inline ignores.

5.  **Editorial Comments in Documentation Code Blocks:**
    *   **Action:** Removed various editorial comments (e.g., `# Updated imports`, `# Added reason`, `# Changed RewardOutput`) from code examples in several documentation files to improve clarity.
    *   **Files Updated:**
        *   `docs/developer_guide/reward_function_anatomy.mdx`
        *   `docs/examples/basic_examples/basic_reward_function.mdx`
        *   `docs/developer_guide/evaluation_workflows.mdx`
        *   `docs/developer_guide/implementation_notes.mdx`
        *   `docs/examples/advanced_examples/advanced_reward_functions.mdx`
    *   **Impact:** Improves the readability and professionalism of code examples in the documentation.

### VI. Folder-by-Folder Review & Improvement Areas (Ongoing)

This section will be populated during the systematic review of the repository. Findings will be linked to the rubrics above.

#### 1. Top-Level Configuration Files

*   Files Reviewed: `.flake8`, `.gitignore`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
*   **General Assessment:** The project utilizes standard configuration files for linting, version control ignores, and pre-commit hooks, which is good practice.
*   **Findings & Recommendations:**
    *   **`.flake8`:**
        *   `max-line-length = 80`: Defined. (R1, P1)
        *   `ignore = E203, W503`: Standard for compatibility with `black`. (R1, P1)
    *   **`.gitignore`:**
        *   Comprehensive and well-structured, covering Python standards and project-specific files/directories. (R1, P3)
        *   Minor: `samples.json` is listed with a comment `# If this is a specific file to ignore`. Confirm if it's still needed.
    *   **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`:**
        *   Uses `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `mypy`, and standard pre-commit hooks. (R1, P1, P2)
        *   **Inconsistency (R1, P1): Line Length Mismatch & Flake8 Configuration.**
            *   `.flake8` sets `max-line-length = 80`.
            *   `black` hook uses `line-length=88`.
            *   `flake8` hook uses `max-line-length=2000` (effectively disabling its check) and `max-complexity=100` (very high).
            *   **Recommendation:**
                1.  Standardize on a single line length (e.g., 88 for `black` compatibility, or 80 if strictly preferred). Configure `black` in `pyproject.toml` (if moving settings there) or its hook args. Update `.flake8` to match or remove its line length check if `black` is the sole enforcer.
                2.  Lower `flake8`'s `max-complexity` in the hook (e.g., to 15-25) for more meaningful complexity checks.
        *   **Opportunity (R1, P1): Review Ignored Flake8 Errors in Pre-commit.**
            *   The `flake8` hook ignores many errors: `E402,F401,F541,W503,E203,F811,E226,F841,E704,E713,E712,E231,E731`.
            *   **Recommendation:** Re-evaluate this list. While some (e.g., `E203`, `W503`, `E226`, `E231`) are for `black` compatibility, others like `F401` (unused import), `F541` (f-string missing placeholders), `F841` (unused variable), `E712` (boolean comparison), `E713` (membership test), `E731` (lambda assignment) are generally useful checks. Consider re-enabling them.
        *   **Opportunity (R2.1): Enhance Docstring Checking.**
            *   The `flake8` hook has `flake8-docstrings` commented out.
            *   **Recommendation:** Consider enabling `flake8-docstrings` (or `pydocstyle` directly as a hook) to enforce docstring presence and style.
        *   **`mypy` hook:** Configuration (`--ignore-missing-imports`, `additional_dependencies`) seems reasonable for a project adopting typing. (P2)

#### 2. README.md

*   File Reviewed: `README.md`
*   **General Assessment:** The `README.md` is comprehensive, covering installation, authentication, basic and advanced usage, CLI, and development. Many existing items in "II. `README.md` Enhancements" of this plan are still relevant.
*   **Findings & Recommendations (reinforcing existing plan items and adding new minor points):**
    *   **Authentication (Existing Plan Items I.2, III.12):**
        *   Good: Details on env vars and `~/.fireworks/auth.ini` are present.
        *   Opportunity: Add guidance on *where* users obtain API keys (e.g., "from your Fireworks AI account dashboard") as per plan item I.2.
    *   **Getting Started Example (Existing Plan Item II.4):**
        *   Good: Uses `EvaluateResult` and `MetricResult`.
        *   Opportunity: Add comments explaining `original_messages` and `**kwargs` or simplify the first example by omitting them if not strictly necessary for a basic case.
    *   **CLI Placeholders (Existing Plan Items I.1, II.4, II.6):**
        *   Opportunity: Clarify `./path/to/metrics` (e.g., use a concrete example path from `examples/`) and explain the `name=` part of the `--metrics-folders` argument.
    *   **Programmatic Deployment:**
        *   Opportunity: The README shows two styles of programmatic deployment (`create_evaluation` function and a `my_function.deploy()` method). Clarify their relationship or ensure consistency for better understanding.
    *   **Development Section (Existing Plan Item II.5):**
        *   Opportunity: Consider further streamlining this section and linking more prominently to `development/CONTRIBUTING.md` for full development setup details. The link currently exists in "Community and Support".
    *   **Badges (New Minor Suggestion):**
        *   Opportunity: Add standard project badges at the top (PyPI version, license, build status, code coverage) for a quick overview. (R2.2)
    *   **Overall Structure (Related to Existing Plan Item IV.16 "Taste"):**
        *   Opportunity: For a more streamlined initial experience, consider if some detailed sections (e.g., advanced programmatic deployment, multiple metrics example) could be briefly summarized with clear links to the full documentation.

#### 3. setup.py (Packaging & Dependencies)

*   File Reviewed: `setup.py`
*   **General Assessment:** The `setup.py` file is well-structured for packaging, defining dependencies, entry points, and metadata.
*   **Findings & Recommendations:**
    *   **Core Dependencies (`install_requires`) (R6):**
        *   List appears reasonable.
        *   `openai==1.78.1` is pinned. **Opportunity:** Evaluate if a compatible range (e.g., `openai>=1.78.1,<2.0.0` or `~=1.78.1`) could be used for more flexibility while maintaining stability, reducing the need for frequent manual bumps for minor `openai` updates.
    *   **Optional Dependencies (`extras_require`) (R6):**
        *   `dev` group:
            *   Good inclusion of development, testing, and linting tools.
            *   Heavy libraries (`transformers`, `torch`, `trl`, `peft`, `datasets`) are correctly in `dev`. **Opportunity:** If any non-dev library features depend on these, consider a separate user-installable extra (e.g., `reward-kit[trl_integration]`).
            *   `autopep8` is listed; `black` is also used (via pre-commit). **Opportunity:** Review if `autopep8` is still needed or if `black` suffices as the standard formatter.
        *   `deepseek` group:
            *   `difflib` is listed but is a standard library module. **Recommendation:** Remove `difflib` from here.
            *   **Opportunity:** Document the purpose of the `deepseek` extra and when users should install it.
    *   **Metadata (P4):**
        *   `long_description` is a short string. **Recommendation:** Populate `long_description` from `README.md` to provide a richer description on PyPI. This typically involves adding `long_description_content_type="text/markdown"`.
    *   **Modernization (P4 - Opportunity):**
        *   Consider migrating from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml` for build system declaration (PEP 517/518) and package metadata (PEP 621). This aligns with current Python packaging best practices. This is a larger undertaking.

#### 4. mypy.ini (Type Checking Configuration)

*   File Reviewed: `mypy.ini`
*   **General Assessment:** The file configures MyPy for static type checking, with different strictness levels for the main codebase and dependencies.
*   **Findings & Recommendations (P2 - Type Hinting):**
    *   **Python Version:** `python_version = 3.10` is set. `setup.py` specifies `>=3.8`. **Opportunity:** Ensure `mypy`'s `python_version` aligns with the lowest actively supported and tested Python version for the project, or run mypy across all supported versions in CI.
    *   **Strictness Settings:**
        *   Good: `no_implicit_optional = True`, `strict_optional = True`.
        *   Less Strict: `warn_return_any = False`, `disallow_untyped_defs = False` (also for `reward_kit.*`), `disallow_incomplete_defs = False` (also for `reward_kit.*`). **Opportunity:** Gradually increase strictness over time by enabling these settings, especially for the core `reward_kit` code.
    *   **Disabled Error Codes (High Priority Concern):**
        *   A very long list of error codes is globally disabled via `disable_error_code = import-not-found, truthy-function, no-redef, assignment, union-attr, misc, name-defined, index, arg-type, operator, var-annotated, return-value, call-arg, attr-defined`.
        *   This significantly undermines the benefits of static type checking, as many fundamental checks (e.g., `arg-type`, `return-value`, `attr-defined`, `name-defined`) are turned off.
        *   **Recommendation (High Priority):**
            1.  Systematically review each error code in the `disable_error_code` list.
            2.  Remove them one by one (or in small groups) from the global disable list.
            3.  Fix the type errors that MyPy then reports in the codebase.
            4.  If a specific line of code requires an ignore for a justifiable reason, use an inline comment: `# type: ignore[error-code] # Justification for ignore`.
            5.  This effort will substantially improve code quality and reliability.
    *   **`ignore_missing_imports`:**
        *   Set to `True` globally and for some specific third-party packages. The pre-commit hook also uses `--ignore-missing-imports`.
        *   **Opportunity:** While common, strive to add type stubs (`types-*` packages) for dependencies where possible to reduce the scope of `ignore_missing_imports`. This provides better type coverage.

#### 5. pytest.ini (Test Runner Configuration)

*   File Reviewed: `pytest.ini`
*   **General Assessment:** The `pytest.ini` provides sensible defaults for test discovery and `asyncio` test handling.
*   **Findings & Recommendations (R3 - Testing):**
    *   **Asyncio Configuration:** `asyncio_mode = strict` and `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function` are good settings.
    *   **Test Discovery:** Standard patterns for `testpaths`, `python_files`, `python_classes`, `python_functions` are used correctly.
    *   **Opportunities for Enhancement (Optional):**
        *   **Test Coverage:** If `pytest-cov` is used for monitoring test coverage, consider adding default configuration to `pytest.ini` (e.g., `addopts = --cov=reward_kit --cov-report=term-missing`).
        *   **Custom Markers:** If custom `pytest` markers are used (e.g., `@pytest.mark.slow`), register them in `pytest.ini` under a `markers` section to avoid warnings and improve clarity.
        *   **Logging:** If application logging is important during tests, consider adding `log_cli = true` and related log formatting options to `pytest.ini`.

#### 6. Makefile (Development Workflow Scripts)

*   File Reviewed: `Makefile`
*   **General Assessment:** The Makefile provides a good set of targets for common development tasks (clean, build, test, lint, format, release) and includes a helpful `help` target.
*   **Findings & Recommendations:**
    *   **Inconsistency with Pre-commit Hooks (High Priority Concern - R1, P1):**
        *   The `lint`, `typecheck`, and `format` targets in the Makefile may produce different results or cover different files/configurations than the pre-commit hooks.
            *   **Paths:** Makefile targets often specify only `reward_kit`, while pre-commit usually acts on all changed/staged files (potentially including `tests`, `examples`).
            *   **Configuration Mismatch:**
                *   `flake8`: The `make lint` command uses `.flake8`, while the pre-commit `flake8` hook has its own, significantly different, set of arguments (line length, ignores, complexity).
                *   `black`: `make format` uses `black reward_kit` (which would use `pyproject.toml` or defaults), while the pre-commit `black` hook specifies `line-length=88`.
        *   **Recommendation (High Priority):**
            1.  **Centralize Configuration:** Define tool configurations (e.g., `black` line length, `flake8` ignores/max-line-length/complexity) in their respective configuration files (`.flake8`, `mypy.ini`) or, preferably, in `pyproject.toml`.
            2.  **Consistent Application:** Ensure both pre-commit hooks and Makefile targets use these centralized configurations.
            3.  **Consistent Scope:** Ensure Makefile targets for linting, formatting, and type checking cover all relevant Python directories (e.g., `reward_kit`, `tests`, `examples`). Consider using a Makefile variable like `PYTHON_DIRS = reward_kit tests examples` for these commands.
    *   **`sync-docs` Target (R2.2):**
        *   This target appears highly specific to a particular local setup (`~/home/docs/evaluators/`).
        *   The `sed -i -E` command might not be portable between macOS (BSD sed) and Linux (GNU sed) without modification (macOS `sed -i` requires an extension, e.g., `sed -i '' ...`).
        *   **Recommendation:**
            1.  Clarify the purpose and intended audience of the `sync-docs` target in comments within the Makefile or project documentation.
            2.  If intended for broader use, improve portability (e.g., use `sed -i '' ...` or a Python script for text manipulation) and consider making the destination path configurable (e.g., via an environment variable or Makefile argument).
    *   **Release Process:** The `release` target (chaining `lint typecheck test build upload`) is a good practice.

#### 7. CHANGELOG.md

*   File Reviewed: `CHANGELOG.md`
*   **General Assessment:** The file correctly adopts the "Keep a Changelog" format and references Semantic Versioning. It includes an `[Unreleased]` section and instructions for maintenance.
*   **Findings & Recommendations (R2.2 - Project Documentation):**
    *   **Outdated Content (High Priority Concern):**
        *   The last version entry is `[0.2.4] - YYYY-MM-DD` (with a placeholder date).
        *   The current project version (from `setup.py`) is `0.2.11`.
        *   Changes for versions `0.2.5` through `0.2.11` are missing.
        *   **Recommendation (High Priority):**
            1.  Backfill the changelog with notable changes for all missing versions (`0.2.5` to `0.2.11`). This may require reviewing git commit history between tags.
            2.  Update the release date for version `0.2.4`.
    *   **Maintenance Process:**
        *   **Recommendation:** Reinforce or establish a consistent process for updating the `[Unreleased]` section with changes as they are made, and for finalizing these entries upon each new release, as per "Keep a Changelog" guidelines.

#### 8. LICENSE

*   File Reviewed: `LICENSE`
*   **General Assessment:** The file contains the standard text for the Apache License, Version 2.0, which is appropriate and clearly stated in `setup.py` as well.
*   **Findings & Recommendations (R2.2 - Project Documentation, R1 - Maintainability):**
    *   **Standard License:** Correctly uses Apache 2.0.
    *   **`NOTICE` File (Consideration):**
        *   The Apache License 2.0 (Section 4d) describes the use of a `NOTICE` file for attributions.
        *   **Opportunity:** Review if the project or its dependencies require any specific attributions that should be included in a `NOTICE` file in the repository root. (Currently, no `NOTICE` file is present).
    *   **Copyright Headers in Source Files (Consideration):**
        *   The license appendix recommends applying a boilerplate copyright/license notice to work files.
        *   **Opportunity:** Verify if source files (e.g., `.py` files) consistently include copyright and license headers for file-level clarity. This is a common best practice.

#### 9. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

*   File Reviewed: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
*   **General Assessment:** The file is an excellent adaptation of the Contributor Covenant v2.1, a widely respected standard.
*   **Findings & Recommendations (R2.2 - Project Documentation):**
    *   **Completeness and Clarity:** The document is comprehensive, clearly outlining expected behaviors, unacceptable behaviors, enforcement responsibilities, and detailed enforcement guidelines.
    *   **Contact Information:** Provides a clear email address (`conduct@fireworks.ai`) for reporting incidents.
    *   **Attribution:** Correctly attributes the Contributor Covenant.
    *   **No significant improvements needed.** This document is well-implemented.

#### 10. SECURITY.md

*   File Reviewed: `SECURITY.md`
*   **General Assessment:** The security policy is clear, follows best practices for vulnerability reporting, and defines version support for security updates.
*   **Findings & Recommendations (R8 - Security, R2.2 - Project Documentation):**
    *   **Supported Versions:** Clearly defined with a note for future updates.
    *   **Vulnerability Reporting:** Excellent instructions for private disclosure via `conduct@fireworks.ai`, including necessary report details and expectations for response and responsible disclosure.
    *   **Minor Considerations:**
        *   **Reporting Email:** While `conduct@fireworks.ai` is functional, a dedicated `security@fireworks.ai` alias could be considered for distinct routing of security reports, depending on team workflow.
        *   **GitHub Security Advisories:** Consider mentioning if GitHub Security Advisories will be used for managing and disclosing fixed vulnerabilities.
    *   **Overall, a strong and clear security policy.**

### Directory: api_specifications/

#### 1. api_specifications/fireworks.swagger.yaml

*   File Reviewed: `api_specifications/fireworks.swagger.yaml`
*   **General Assessment:** This file provides an OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger) definition for the Fireworks AI Gateway REST API, which `reward-kit` interacts with. Its presence is valuable for developers.
*   **Findings & Recommendations:**
    *   **Documentation Value (R2.2):**
        *   The spec itself serves as detailed documentation for the external API.
        *   **Recommendation:** Add a section to the `reward_kit` internal/developer documentation (e.g., in `development/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` or a new `EXTERNAL_APIS.md`) that:
            *   References this `fireworks.swagger.yaml` file.
            *   Explains its purpose as the API definition for the Fireworks AI platform.
            *   Notes that it can be a useful reference for understanding integration points and data models used by `reward-kit`.
    *   **API Spec Details (Observations for context, not direct `reward-kit` actions):**
        *   The spec is comprehensive, covering many aspects of the Fireworks platform.
        *   It uses Swagger 2.0; OpenAPI 3.x is a newer standard.
        *   The `info.version` is `0.0.0`, which might indicate a development or non-public version.
        *   Some descriptions within the spec contain "TODO" items, indicating areas of the API or its definition that might evolve.
    *   **`reward-kit` Client Robustness (R4, R7 - General Consideration for `reward_kit` code):**
        *   The parts of `reward_kit` that make calls to the API defined in this spec should have robust error handling and be able to manage various API responses gracefully. (This is a general coding standard rather than a specific change to the Swagger file itself).

### Directory: docs/

This directory contains the project's user-facing documentation.

#### 1. docs/documentation_home.mdx

*   File Reviewed: `docs/documentation_home.mdx`
*   **General Assessment:** Serves as a well-structured main entry point for the documentation, linking to various guides, examples, and references.
*   **Findings & Recommendations (R2.2 - Project Documentation):**
    *   **Structure:** Logical organization into Developer Guide, Examples, Tutorials, API/CLI References, Best Practices.
    *   **MDX Format:** Indicates suitability for modern static site generators.
    *   **Community Links:** The "Community and Support" section lists "GitHub Issues" and "Contributing Guide" as text.
        *   **Recommendation:** Convert these to hyperlinks pointing to the project's GitHub issues page and `development/CONTRIBUTING.md` (or its rendered equivalent). Consider adding a link to `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` here as well.

#### 2. docs/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.mdx

*   File Reviewed: `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.mdx`
*   **General Assessment:** An excellent meta-document tracking documentation completeness, outlining future work, and providing guidelines for format and maintenance.
*   **Findings & Recommendations (R2.2 - Project Documentation):**
    *   **Self-Awareness:** Clearly lists completed sections and, more importantly, "Recommended Next Steps."
    *   **Actionable Roadmap:** The "Recommended Next Steps" (comprehensive API reference, CLI guide, best practices, domain-specific guides, integration guides) provide a clear path for substantial documentation improvement.
        *   **Recommendation:** These "Recommended Next Steps" should be treated as high-priority items in the overall project improvement plan. Progress against these should be tracked.
    *   **Guidelines:** The recommendations for documentation structure, format, and maintenance are solid and should be adhered to.
    *   **Alignment:** The "Completed Documentation" seems to align with existing files linked from `documentation_home.mdx`, but the "Recommended Next Steps" for API/CLI/Best Practices suggest these areas require significant expansion beyond any current stubs.

#### 3. docs/api_reference/ (Specific Files)

*   Files Reviewed: `api_overview.mdx`, `data_models.mdx`, `reward_function_class.mdx`, `reward_function_decorator.mdx`.
*   **General Assessment:** These files provide a good foundation for the API reference, covering key components. However, as noted in `DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.mdx`, a more "comprehensive" API reference is a goal, implying these might need expansion or be supplemented with more detailed, potentially auto-generated, documentation for all public modules, classes, and functions.
*   **Specific Findings & Recommendations:**
    *   **`api_overview.mdx` (R2.2):**
        *   Good high-level overview of core components, modules, and common patterns.
        *   **Opportunity:** The "Modules" section is high-level. A full API reference would detail the public members of each module. The `rewards` module, in particular, could benefit from a more comprehensive listing or linking strategy to its various built-in functions.
    *   **`data_models.mdx` (R2.2, R7 - High Priority):**
        *   Documents `Message`, `EvaluateResult`, `MetricResult`.
        *   **CRITICAL INCONSISTENCY:** The documented structure of `EvaluateResult` and `MetricResult` (using `is_score_valid`) conflicts with "Approved Action Item 1" (which specifies `success: bool` for `MetricResult` and no `is_score_valid` on `EvaluateResult`). Examples in `README.md`, `api_overview.mdx`, `reward_function_class.mdx`, and `reward_function_decorator.mdx` *do* reflect the unified structure.
        *   **Recommendation (High Priority):** Update `data_models.mdx` immediately to align with the unified data model structure (i.e., `MetricResult` should have `success: bool`; `is_score_valid` should be removed from both `MetricResult` and `EvaluateResult` if it's not part of the unified model).
        *   **Opportunity:** Clarify if "other data models" mentioned in the intro need to be documented here.
    *   **`reward_function_class.mdx` (R2.1, R2.2):**
        *   Good documentation for the `RewardFunction` class, its constructor, `__call__`, and `get_trl_adapter` methods. Examples are consistent with unified data models.
        *   **Opportunity:** Verify all public methods/properties are covered. Clarify interaction of `**kwargs` from constructor vs. call time. Detail `original_messages` default behavior (and note its planned deprecation).
    *   **`reward_function_decorator.mdx` (R2.1, R2.2):**
        *   Good documentation for the `@reward_function` decorator, including its purpose, usage, parameter/return requirements, and the `.deploy()` method. Examples are consistent with unified data models.
        *   **Opportunity:** Clarify the `metadata` keyword argument pattern shown in an example versus the general `**kwargs` in the parameter requirements. Note the planned deprecation of `original_messages`.

#### 4. docs/cli_reference/cli_overview.mdx

*   File Reviewed: `docs/cli_reference/cli_overview.mdx`
*   **General Assessment:** A comprehensive and well-structured guide for the currently available CLI commands (`preview`, `deploy`, `agent-eval`). Includes syntax, options, examples, common workflows, and troubleshooting.
*   **Findings & Recommendations (R2.2 - Project Documentation):**
    *   **Completeness for Existing Commands:** Appears quite thorough for the commands it covers.
    *   **"Coming Soon" Commands:** Notes `list` and `delete` commands as planned. These will need documentation once implemented.
    *   **Authentication Section:** The authentication guidance is brief compared to `README.md`.
        *   **Recommendation:** Expand this section to include details on `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` and the `~/.fireworks/auth.ini` file, or link to a central, detailed authentication guide.
    *   **`--metrics-folders` Explanation:** While syntax is shown, the structure of a "metric folder" and the meaning of its `name` component are not detailed.
        *   **Recommendation:** Add a brief explanation or link to a dedicated section clarifying this (supports main plan item I.1).

#### 5. docs/developer_guide/ (Selected Files)

*   **General Assessment:** This directory contains conceptual guides for developers. The `DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.mdx` indicates these are largely "Completed," but a review can confirm quality and identify minor improvements.
*   **`docs/developer_guide/getting_started.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Covers "What is a Reward Function?", a UI-based workflow on `www.fireworks.ai`, then SDK installation, auth, basic function structure, testing, previewing, and deploying.
    *   **Good:** Code examples for function structure and SDK usage are clear and use the unified data models correctly.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **UI vs. SDK Workflow Clarity:** The initial UI-focused section ("Getting started on www.fireworks.ai") feels disconnected from the subsequent SDK-focused content. **Recommendation:** Clarify the relationship between these two workflows. Are they alternative paths or complementary?
        *   **Broken Links/Images:** A text link `creating_your_first_reward_function` seems broken. The image `images/create_evaluator_data.png` is duplicated. **Recommendation:** Fix these.
        *   **Placeholder URL:** The `git clone` URL is a placeholder. **Recommendation:** Update to the correct project URL.
        *   **Authentication Consistency:** The auth setup section is brief. **Recommendation:** Align with the more detailed auth information in `README.md` or link to a central auth guide.
        *   **Path Placeholders:** Uses `./path/to/metric`. **Recommendation:** Use concrete examples or explicitly state it's a user-defined path.
*   **`docs/developer_guide/reward_function_anatomy.mdx` (R2.2, R2.1):**
    *   **Content:** Details the `@reward_function` decorator, function parameters (including `original_messages` default behavior), return value (`EvaluateResult`), multi-component functions, deployment, error handling, and metadata usage.
    *   **Good:** Explanations are clear. Examples use unified data models correctly. The error handling example is good.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Editorial Comments:** Code examples contain comments like `# Added imports`, `# Changed RewardOutput...`. **Recommendation:** Remove these editorial comments from the final documentation.
        *   **`metadata` Parameter:** The "Working with Metadata" example shows `metadata` as an explicit named parameter, while the "Function Parameters" section lists `**kwargs`. **Recommendation:** Clarify if `metadata` is a specially recognized/recommended named argument or just an example of using `**kwargs`.
        *   **`original_messages`:** Will require updates when this parameter is deprecated/removed.
*   **`docs/developer_guide/core_data_types.mdx` (R2.2, R7 - High Priority):**
    *   **Content:** Explains `Message`, `EvaluateResult`, `MetricResult`, legacy types, migration, and best practices.
    *   **CRITICAL INCONSISTENCY:** This document, like `docs/api_reference/data_models.mdx`, describes `EvaluateResult` and `MetricResult` using an `is_score_valid: bool` field. This conflicts with "Approved Action Item 1" and other documentation (`README.md`, `api_overview.mdx`, `reward_function_class.mdx`, `reward_function_decorator.mdx`) which use `success: bool` for `MetricResult` and do not show `is_score_valid` on `EvaluateResult`.
    *   **Recommendation (High Priority - CRITICAL):** Update this document urgently to align with the unified data model structure. All references and examples for `MetricResult` should use `success: bool`. The `is_score_valid` field should be removed from `EvaluateResult` documentation if it's not part of the final unified model. The migration guide and best practices sections also need to reflect these corrections.
    *   **Good Aspects (once corrected):** The structure, explanation of message types, migration guide, and best practices are otherwise helpful.
*   **`docs/developer_guide/evaluation_workflows.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Describes the end-to-end workflow: local development, testing, preview (CLI & programmatic), deployment (direct, CLI, custom provider, `create_evaluation`), and integration (TRL, `firectl`). Includes best practices.
    *   **Good:** Comprehensive workflow coverage. Examples use unified data models correctly.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Editorial Comments:** Remove commented-out legacy code like `# from reward_kit import RewardOutput...` from examples.
        *   **Path Placeholders:** Clarify placeholders like `./path/to/helpfulness_metric` or use concrete examples.
        *   **Metric Folder Structure:** Briefly explain or link to details on what a "metric folder" should contain when paths like `./path/to/metric_folder` are mentioned.
        *   **`firectl` Context:** Provide a brief explanation or link for `firectl` if it's not a universally known tool within the target audience's ecosystem.
*   **`docs/developer_guide/implementation_notes.mdx` (R2.2, R10):**
    *   **Content:** Provides technical details on the Agent Evaluation Framework CLI design (showing `argparse` code), task bundle loading, tool registry management, core classes, database management, and reward function integration for agent eval (noting the `db` parameter).
    *   **Audience:** Appears targeted at contributors or advanced users needing internal details.
    *   **Good:** Offers valuable insight into internal mechanics. Reward function example uses unified data models.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Placement/Linking:** Confirm its intended audience and ensure it's appropriately linked (e.g., from a more general `agent_evaluation.mdx` guide if this provides deeper technical details). It's not linked from `documentation_home.mdx`.
        *   **Redundancy with CLI Overview:** The `argparse` snippets for CLI options overlap with `docs/cli_reference/cli_overview.mdx`. Ensure this page focuses on *implementation rationale* if CLI details are already covered elsewhere for users.
        *   **Editorial Comments:** Remove comments like `# Ensure imports...` from code examples.
        *   **Core Classes Detail:** Could slightly expand on the roles/interactions of core classes (`ToolRegistry`, `Database`, `AgentEvaluator`) for developers.
*   **`docs/developer_guide/agent_evaluation.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Explains the Agent Evaluation Framework, Task Bundle structure, and detailed CLI usage for `agent-eval` with examples.
    *   **Good:** Clear explanation of task bundles. Comprehensive CLI examples for `agent-eval`.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Overlap with CLI Overview:** Significant overlap in documenting `agent-eval` options and examples with `docs/cli_reference/cli_overview.mdx`. **Recommendation:** Consider making `cli_overview.mdx` the single source of truth for detailed CLI command syntax/options, and have this guide focus more on concepts, linking to the CLI reference for command specifics.
        *   **Missing "Next Steps":** Lacks a "Next Steps" section. **Recommendation:** Add links to related guides (e.g., reward function anatomy, tool creation, implementation notes for advanced users).
        *   **Link to Implementation Notes:** Consider linking to `implementation_notes.mdx` for users interested in deeper technical details.

#### 6. docs/examples/ (Selected Files)

*   **`docs/examples/examples_overview.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Serves as a table of contents for example documentation, categorized into "Basic Examples" and "Advanced Examples," linking to files within subdirectories.
    *   **Good:** Provides a structured entry point to example documentation.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Link Consistency:** The link text "Reward Functions Overview" here points to `basic_examples/reward_functions_overview.md`. `documentation_home.mdx` had a similar link pointing to `examples/reward_functions_overview`. **Recommendation:** Ensure consistency in how this central overview of examples is linked or named across different documentation entry points.
        *   **Coverage of Subdirectories:** The `docs/examples/` directory contains subdirectories like `accuracy_length/`, `flight_task/`, `trl_integration/` which are not explicitly linked from this overview page (though `e2b/` seems covered by an "Advanced Example" link). **Recommendation:** If these other directories contain user-facing example documentation, they should be categorized and linked from `examples_overview.mdx` for better discoverability.
*   **`docs/examples/basic_examples/reward_functions_overview.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Provides a catalog of out-of-the-box reward functions, categorized by purpose, with import statements and minimal usage examples. Includes a "Choosing the Right Reward Function" table and an example of combining functions.
    *   **Good:** Excellent categorization and quick reference table. Example for combining functions uses unified data models correctly.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **"Next Steps" Links:** Many links under "Explore individual reward function documentation" (e.g., `../api_reference/reward_functions/format.md`) likely point to non-existent or placeholder pages, as the detailed API reference for each function/module is still a "Recommended Next Step" in `DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.mdx`. **Recommendation:** Review and update these links to point to relevant existing documentation or ensure the linked pages are created.
        *   **Clarity of Output in Snippets:** The minimal examples for individual built-in rewards show the call but not the structure of the returned `EvaluateResult`. **Recommendation (Minor):** Consider adding a brief illustration (e.g., `print(result.score)`) for a few examples to reinforce the output structure.
*   **`docs/examples/basic_examples/basic_reward_function.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Provides a detailed, runnable example of a custom `clarity_reward` function, including structure, testing, deployment, code explanation, and extension ideas.
    *   **Good:** Excellent structure for an example guide. The example code is clear, demonstrates good practices (error checking, multi-component logic), and uses the unified data models correctly.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Editorial Comments:** The Python code block contains numerous editorial comments (e.g., `# Updated imports`, `# Added success`). **Recommendation (High Priority for this page):** Remove these comments as they are distracting and not part of the example logic.
        *   **`original_messages` / `**kwargs`:** The function signature includes these, though they are not used in the example logic. This is consistent but will need updates when `original_messages` is deprecated.
*   **`docs/examples/basic_examples/combined_metrics_rewards.mdx` (R2.2, R7):**
    *   **Content:** Explains combining multiple evaluation aspects, details the `cosine_scaled_accuracy_length_reward` function, and shows how to create custom combined metrics.
    *   **Good:** Thorough documentation for `cosine_scaled_accuracy_length_reward` (features, parameters, use cases). The custom combination example (`accuracy_reasoning_reward`) correctly uses unified data models.
    *   **Inconsistency Concern (High Priority for this page):** The "Return Value" description for the built-in `cosine_scaled_accuracy_length_reward` states its `EvaluateResult` includes an `is_score_valid: bool` field. This needs verification against the actual implementation and alignment with the unified data model (which typically places `success: bool` in `MetricResult` and does not have `is_score_valid` directly on `EvaluateResult`).
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Editorial Comments:** Remove comments like `# Updated imports` from code examples.
        *   **Scope of "Available Combined Metric Rewards":** If other pre-built combined rewards exist, list them. If not, clarify the focus on `cosine_scaled_accuracy_length_reward`.
*   **`docs/examples/basic_examples/general_usage.mdx` (R2.2, R7 - High Priority):**
    *   **Content:** Provides setup instructions and walkthroughs for running Python example scripts from the top-level `/examples` directory (e.g., `cosine_scaled_example.py`, `evaluation_preview_example.py`). Also includes CLI examples and a custom metric template.
    *   **Good:** Useful for users wanting to run standalone example scripts.
    *   **CRITICAL INCONSISTENCY:** The `word_count` metric snippet and the "Example Custom Metric" template **incorrectly use `is_score_valid`** in `EvaluateResult` and `MetricResult`, conflicting with the unified model.
    *   **Recommendation (High Priority - CRITICAL):** Update all code snippets on this page to use `success: bool` in `MetricResult` and remove `is_score_valid` from `EvaluateResult` (unless intentionally different and documented as such).
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Authentication Consistency:** Align the "Configure API Access" section with `README.md` regarding `FIREWORKS_ACCOUNT_ID` and `auth.ini`.
        *   **Page Purpose:** Clarify its role as a guide for *running example scripts* versus `examples_overview.mdx` which is an index of example documentation pages.
*   **`docs/examples/advanced_examples/advanced_reward_functions.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Showcases several advanced reward function examples: a multi-component evaluator, a composite reward function, and a contextual reward function. Includes best practices.
    *   **Good:** Excellent, detailed examples demonstrating complex logic and combination of metrics. Uses unified data models correctly.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Editorial Comments:** Code examples contain comments like `# Updated imports`. **Recommendation (High Priority for this page):** Remove these editorial comments.
        *   **Illustrative Imports:** The "Composite Reward Function" example uses placeholder import paths (e.g., `from reward_components.helpfulness`). **Recommendation:** Add a small note clarifying these are illustrative.
        *   **"Next Steps" Links:** Verify links like `../tutorials/custom_providers.md` and `../examples/domain_specific_evaluators.md` as they might point to planned, but not yet existing, content.
*   **`docs/examples/advanced_examples/code_execution_evaluation.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Comprehensive guide on local code execution rewards, covering Python/JS, security, output comparison, use cases, best practices, and limitations.
    *   **Good:** Very detailed and user-friendly. Strong emphasis on security features. Examples are clear.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Output Structure:** Briefly describe the typical `EvaluateResult` structure returned by `local_code_execution_reward`, including common metric keys in `result.metrics`.
        *   **`original_messages` for Output Extraction:** Note that the documented method for automatic expected output extraction (using `original_messages=messages`) will need to be revised when `original_messages` is deprecated.
*   **`docs/examples/advanced_examples/code_execution_with_e2b.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Explains using E2B cloud sandbox for code execution, covering prerequisites, basic usage, supported languages, advanced options (auto output extraction, fallback to local), parameters, and return value.
    *   **Good:** Comprehensive guide for E2B integration. Clear examples, good parameter table, and helpful description of key metrics in the return value. The fallback mechanism example is a plus.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **API Key in Example:** The basic usage example shows `api_key="your_e2b_api_key"`. **Recommendation:** Prefer showing API key retrieval from environment variables in examples, or add a strong warning against hardcoding real keys.
        *   **`original_messages` for Output Extraction:** This feature's documentation will need an update when `original_messages` is deprecated.
        *   **Supported Languages:** Ensure the list is complete if more languages are supported via E2B.
*   **`docs/examples/advanced_examples/deepseek_prover_v2.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Describes reward functions for evaluating Lean theorem proofs (`lean_prover_reward`, `deepseek_prover_v2_reward`, `deepseek_huggingface_prover_benchmark`), including installation, usage examples, scoring methodology, and references.
    *   **Good:** Clear explanation of specialized reward functions. Good examples and scoring breakdown.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Formal Parameter Documentation:** While examples show parameters, adding a formal parameter list/table for each of the three Lean prover reward functions (detailing all parameters, types, defaults) would improve it as a reference.
        *   **`MetricResult` in Output:** Clarify that entries in `result.metrics` are `MetricResult` objects with `score`, `reason`, and `success` attributes.
*   **`docs/examples/advanced_examples/function_calling_evaluation.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Details evaluation of LLM function calls using Schema Jaccard, LLM Judge, and Composite rewards. Covers prerequisites, usage, "how it works" for each, advanced options, and a use case.
    *   **Good:** Comprehensive and clear guide with practical examples.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **API Key Handling:** Examples show `os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_openai_api_key"`. **Recommendation:** Advise users to set API keys in their shell environment rather than in scripts, or add strong warnings if shown for example simplicity.
        *   **Formal Parameter/Return Documentation:** Add formal parameter lists/tables and detailed return value structures (especially `result.metrics` keys) for `schema_jaccard_reward`, `llm_judge_reward`, and `composite_function_call_reward`.
        *   **Schema Standard:** Briefly mention if `expected_schema` should follow a standard (e.g., JSON Schema).
*   **`docs/examples/advanced_examples/json_schema_validation.mdx` (R2.2):**
    *   **Content:** Explains validating JSON outputs against a schema using `json_schema_reward` and `validate_json_string`. Covers basic usage, custom extraction, handling multiple objects, direct string validation, multiple schemas, use cases, best practices, and limitations.
    *   **Good:** Very comprehensive and clear guide for JSON validation.
    *   **Opportunities for Improvement:**
        *   **Formal Parameter/Return Documentation:**
            *   For `json_schema_reward`: Add a formal parameter table and detail its `EvaluateResult` structure (especially `metrics` keys).
            *   For `validate_json_string`: Clearly document its non-`EvaluateResult` dictionary return type and structure (e.g., `valid: bool`, `errors: Optional[list]`).
        *   **JSON Schema Standard Link (Minor):** Consider linking to json-schema.org.

*(Initial review will start with top-level files and then proceed through directories like `api_specifications/`, `docs/`, `examples/`, `reward_kit/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`)*
