# Open Source Readiness Plan for reward-kit

This document outlines the steps to prepare the `reward-kit` repository for open source, ensuring it is welcoming to contributors, easy to use, and maintainable.

## 1. Licensing

*   **Action**: Review the existing `LICENSE` file.
*   **Goal**: Ensure it's a standard OSI-approved open source license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPLv3) that aligns with the project's goals.
*   **Details**: Clearly state the license in the `README.md` and potentially in file headers.

## 2. Documentation

*   **User Documentation**:
    *   **Action**: Enhance `README.md` to be a comprehensive entry point.
    *   **Goal**: Include project overview, key features, installation instructions, quick start guide, and links to more detailed documentation.
    *   **Action**: Review and expand existing `docs/` content.
    *   **Goal**: Ensure clear, well-organized documentation for users, covering API references, examples, tutorials, and use cases.
        *   Consider using a documentation generator like Sphinx or MkDocs.
*   **Developer/Contributor Documentation**:
    *   **Action**: Review and expand `development/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    *   **Goal**: Detail how to set up a development environment, coding standards, testing procedures, and the pull request process.
    *   **Action**: Create/Update `development/CODING_STYLE.md` (or similar).
    *   **Goal**: Document specific coding conventions, linting rules, and formatting guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
    *   **Action**: Document the project's architecture and design decisions.
    *   **Goal**: Help new contributors understand the codebase (e.g., in `development/system_architecture/`).

## 3. Contribution Guidelines & Community

*   **Action**: Finalize `development/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
*   **Goal**: Clear guidelines on how to contribute, report bugs, and suggest features.
*   **Action**: Create a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
*   **Goal**: Adopt a standard Code of Conduct (e.g., Contributor Covenant) to foster an inclusive and welcoming community. Link to it from `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
*   **Action**: Create Issue and Pull Request templates.
*   **Goal**: Standardize bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests for easier management. These can be placed in a `.github/` directory (e.g., `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`).

## 4. Testing Strategy

*   **Action**: Review and expand the existing tests in the `tests/` directory.
*   **Goal**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests).
*   **Details**:
    *   Use a test runner like `pytest`.
    *   Measure test coverage (e.g., using `pytest-cov`).
    *   Ensure tests are easy to run locally.

## 5. CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)

*   **Goal**: Automate testing, linting, building, and potentially releases using GitHub Actions (GHA).
*   **CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` or similar)**:
    *   **Trigger**: On push to `main` (or `master`) and on every pull request.
    *   **Jobs**:
        1.  **Linting & Formatting Check**:
            *   **Action**: Run linters (e.g., `flake8`, `pylint`) and formatters (e.g., `black`, `isort`) in check mode.
            *   **Tools**: `flake8` (already in use), `black`, `isort`.
        2.  **Testing Across Python Versions**:
            *   **Action**: Set up a matrix build to run tests on all supported Python versions (e.g., 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12).
            *   **Tools**: `pytest`.
            *   **Details**: Ensure dependencies are installed correctly for each version.
        3.  **Build Package**:
            *   **Action**: Build the source distribution (`sdist`) and wheel (`bdist_wheel`).
            *   **Tools**: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` or `python -m build`.
        4.  **(Optional) Documentation Build**:
            *   **Action**: Build documentation to catch errors.
            *   **Tools**: Sphinx, MkDocs, etc.
        5.  **(Optional) Test Coverage Report**:
            *   **Action**: Upload coverage reports (e.g., to Codecov, Coveralls).

## 6. Version Management & Release Process

*   **Action**: Adopt Semantic Versioning (SemVer - `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
*   **Goal**: Clearly communicate the nature of changes between releases.
*   **Release Automation (GHA - `.github/workflows/release.yml` or similar)**:
    *   **Trigger**: On creating a new tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`) or manually.
    *   **Jobs**:
        1.  **Build Package**: (As in CI)
        2.  **Create GitHub Release**:
            *   **Action**: Automatically create a GitHub release entry.
            *   **Details**: Use release notes, potentially auto-generated from commit messages or a changelog.
        3.  **Publish to PyPI**:
            *   **Action**: Automatically publish the package to the Python Package Index (PyPI).
            *   **Security**: Use PyPI API tokens stored as GitHub secrets.
*   **Changelog**:
    *   **Action**: Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md`.
    *   **Goal**: Keep a human-readable log of changes for each version.
    *   **Tools**: Consider tools like `towncrier` or `conventional-changelog` to automate generation from PRs/commits.

## 7. Pre-commit Hooks

*   **Action**: Set up pre-commit hooks.
*   **Goal**: Enforce code style, linting, and formatting automatically before commits are made locally. This improves code quality and reduces CI failures.
*   **Tools**: Use the `pre-commit` framework.
*   **Configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`):**
    *   Include hooks for:
        *   `black` (Python formatter)
        *   `isort` (Python import sorter)
        *   `flake8` (Python linter)
        *   `mypy` (static type checker, if using type hints)
        *   Trailing whitespace removal, end-of-file fixer, etc.
*   **Documentation**: Add instructions in `CONTRIBUTING.md` on how to install and use pre-commit hooks.

## 8. Security

*   **Action**: Add a `SECURITY.md` file.
*   **Goal**: Clearly define how to report security vulnerabilities.
*   **Action**: Enable GitHub Dependabot.
*   **Goal**: Get automated alerts and PRs for outdated/vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Action**: Review code for common security pitfalls (e.g., handling of secrets, input validation if applicable).

## 9. Repository Structure & Hygiene

*   **Action**: Review and clean up the root directory.
*   **Goal**: Ensure a clean and intuitive project structure.
*   **Action**: Update `.gitignore`.
*   **Goal**: Ensure all necessary files/directories (build artifacts, IDE files, OS-specific files, virtual environment directories) are ignored.

## 10. Community Engagement Plan (Optional but Recommended)

*   **Action**: Define channels for community discussion (e.g., GitHub Discussions, mailing list, Discord/Slack).
*   **Goal**: Provide avenues for users and contributors to ask questions and collaborate.
*   **Action**: Consider a roadmap or a way to share future plans.
*   **Goal**: Keep the community informed about the project's direction.
