# Frozen Lake Example Documentation

## Project Overview

This document serves as the main entry point for understanding the Frozen Lake example within the `reward-kit` framework. The project demonstrates how to create a data-driven reinforcement learning environment where an LLM agent can interact with the game through a standardized protocol.

The core of this example is a robust, reproducible evaluation setup. Instead of ad-hoc testing, the agent's performance is measured across a controlled set of initial conditions (defined by random seeds) that are specified in a dataset.

## Project Documents

This project is documented across the following files:

-   **[Implementation Plan](./frozen_lake_plan.md)**: This document outlines the detailed, data-driven plan for the Frozen Lake example, including the dataset structure, task configuration, and the required modifications to the `reward-kit` framework.
-   **[Implementation Context](./frozen_lake_context.md)**: This document provides high-level context on the architecture and data flow of the final implementation, explaining how the different components work together to achieve a data-driven evaluation.

This structure provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the project's design and goals.
