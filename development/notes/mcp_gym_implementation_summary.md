# MCP-Gym Implementation Status

## üü° **CURRENT STATUS: MAJOR PROGRESS - MULTI-ENV PROXY STARTUP FIXED, TOOL DISCOVERY WORKING**

**Recent Progress**: Successfully resolved the multi-environment proxy hanging issue during startup and fixed tool discovery. The proxy now starts correctly and tools are properly registered. However, several critical issues remain for full functionality.

**What's working**:
- ‚úÖ Clean conversation flow (no extra user turns)
- ‚úÖ Proper tool call structure in assistant messages
- ‚úÖ Policy architectural separation (only generates movement actions)
- ‚úÖ No incorrect policy-side termination decisions
- ‚úÖ Server-side termination detection (server correctly returns `terminated=True, reward=1.0` for goals)
- ‚úÖ Rollout system optimization (filters terminated environments to prevent unnecessary LLM calls)
- ‚úÖ Data/control plane separation maintained (observations in tool responses, rewards/termination via resources)
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Control plane resource reading for single environments (type conversion bug)
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Single environment early termination and reward propagation
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Multi-environment proxy startup and tool discovery
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Tool calls now use "lake_move" instead of "unknown"

**What's still broken**:
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Backend server path resolution - proxy can't find server.py file
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Session creation failures - all backend servers fail to start
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL**: Control plane resource queries fail - causing rollout to hang after step 0
- ‚ùå **MISSING**: Control plane metadata not stored in tool message metadata
- ‚ùå **INCOMPLETE**: Multi-environment termination handling (environments should stop when they succeed/fail)

## üö® **CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES**

### **1. ‚úÖ SOLVED: Multi-Environment Proxy Startup Hanging**
**Issue**: Proxy server was hanging during startup due to slow conda environment creation during eager tool discovery.

**Root Cause Found**:
- Eager tool discovery was creating conda environments synchronously during server startup
- This blocked the async event loop and caused hanging
- Tool discovery timing issues prevented proper tool registration

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# Added environment variables for testing
os.environ["FORCE_SIMPLE_PROCESS_MANAGER"] = "true"  # Use simple process manager
# Keep eager tool discovery enabled but use fast simple server processes

# Fixed tool discovery flag setting
self.tools_discovered = True  # Set after successful per-session discovery

# Made _start_backend_server async-compatible
server_port = await loop.run_in_executor(None, self.process_manager.start_server, seed)
```

**Evidence of Fix**:
- ‚úÖ Proxy server starts successfully without hanging
- ‚úÖ Tool calls now use "lake_move" instead of "unknown"
- ‚úÖ Tool responses properly structured: `{"result": {"position": 1, "grid": "...", "action": "RIGHT"}}`
- ‚úÖ Recording files created with proper conversation flow

### **2. ‚ùå CRITICAL: Multi-Environment Trajectories Stop After 1 Step**
**Issue**: Multi-environment test records only step 0 for each environment (3 total lines), then hangs.

**Evidence**:
```bash
wc -l deterministic_policy_trajectory_multi_env.jsonl
# Returns: 3 lines (only step 0 for each of 3 environments)
```

**Root Cause**: Unknown - likely related to:
- Control plane resource reading in multi-environment context
- Session isolation or termination detection issues
- Rollout system not properly continuing after step 0

### **3. ‚ùå MISSING: Control Plane Metadata in Tool Messages**
**Issue**: Control plane information (rewards, termination status) is not being stored in tool message metadata for debugging.

**Current State**: Tool responses contain only data plane information
**Required**: Tool messages should have `.metadata` field with control plane data

**Example Target Format**:
```json
{
  "role": "tool",
  "content": "{\"result\": {...}}",
  "metadata": {
    "control_plane": {
      "reward": 1.0,
      "terminated": true,
      "step": 3
    }
  }
}
```

### **4. ‚ùå INCOMPLETE: Proper Multi-Environment Termination**
**Issue**: Environments should stop taking actions once they reach success/failure states, but continue for other active environments.

**Required Behavior**:
- Environment that reaches goal ‚Üí stops, records final step
- Environment that hits hole ‚Üí stops, records final step
- Other environments ‚Üí continue until their own termination
- Rollout completes when all environments terminated OR max steps reached

### **5. ‚ùå CRITICAL: Backend Server Path Resolution**
**Issue**: Proxy cannot start backend servers due to incorrect file path resolution.

**Root Cause**: Process manager tries to execute server script from wrong working directory:
- **Current**: `/home/bchen/home/reward-kit/server.py` (doesn't exist)
- **Correct**: `examples/frozen_lake_mcp/server.py` (exists)

**Impact**:
- No backend servers can start
- All session creation fails
- Control plane resource queries fail
- Multi-environment rollout hangs indefinitely

**Fix Required**: Update process manager to use correct working directory or absolute paths

## üìã **URGENT NEXT STEPS FOR ENGINEER**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY 1: Fix Backend Server Path Resolution (IMMEDIATE)**
**Goal**: Fix proxy's inability to start backend servers due to incorrect file path resolution.

**üö® CRITICAL**: This is blocking ALL multi-environment functionality. Backend servers cannot start, causing:
- Session creation failures
- Control plane resource query failures
- Multi-environment rollout hanging after step 0

**Action Items**:
1. **Fix working directory**: Process manager should start servers from correct directory
2. **Fix script path**: Ensure server.py path is resolved relative to correct location
3. **Test server startup**: Verify backend servers can start successfully
4. **Verify session creation**: Ensure sessions can be created without errors

**Files to modify**:
- `reward_kit/mcp/simple_process_manager.py` - Process startup with correct working directory
- `reward_kit/mcp/multi_environment_proxy.py` - Server script path resolution (around line 530)

**Test Strategy**:
```bash
# Must run from correct directory
cd examples/frozen_lake_mcp
export FORCE_SIMPLE_PROCESS_MANAGER=true
python -m reward_kit.mcp.multi_environment_proxy --server-script server.py --requirements requirements.txt --port 8095 --max-envs 3

# Should see successful server startup instead of "No such file or directory"
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY 2: Fix Multi-Environment Single-Step Issue (AFTER PATH FIX)**
**Goal**: Make multi-environment trajectories continue beyond step 0.

**üîç ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Backend server startup failing due to incorrect file path resolution.

**Critical Findings**:
1. **Path Resolution Bug**: Proxy looks for `server.py` in `/home/bchen/home/reward-kit/server.py` instead of `examples/frozen_lake_mcp/server.py`
2. **Session Creation Failures**: All backend servers fail to start with "No such file or directory" error
3. **Control Plane Resource Failures**: Resource requests (`control://reward`, `control://status`) fail with "Failed to create session"
4. **Rollout Hanging**: Without control plane data, rollout can't determine termination, causing infinite wait

**Error Evidence**:
```
STDERR: /home/bchen/home/reward-kit/.venv/bin/python: can't open file '/home/bchen/home/reward-kit/server.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
ERROR: Failed to create session 2e60c592dc4d252eda0cf9c82c8e23bb: Could not create environment instance
```

**Action Items**:
1. **Fix server script path resolution**: Ensure proxy uses correct relative path for `server.py`
2. **Fix working directory**: Proxy should run backend servers from correct directory (`examples/frozen_lake_mcp/`)
3. **Test session creation**: Verify backend servers can start successfully
4. **Verify control plane resources**: Ensure `control://reward` and `control://status` work after fix

**Files to investigate**:
- `reward_kit/mcp/multi_environment_proxy.py` - Server script path resolution (lines ~530-540)
- `reward_kit/mcp/simple_process_manager.py` - Process startup with correct working directory
- Backend server startup logic in process manager

**Debug Strategy**:
```bash
# Test from correct directory
cd examples/frozen_lake_mcp
export FORCE_SIMPLE_PROCESS_MANAGER=true
python -m reward_kit.mcp.multi_environment_proxy --server-script server.py --requirements requirements.txt --port 8095 --max-envs 3

# Check if server.py exists in correct location
ls -la examples/frozen_lake_mcp/server.py
```

### **‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY 2: Add Control Plane Metadata to Tool Messages**
**Goal**: Store control plane information in tool message metadata for debugging.

**Action Items**:
1. **Modify tool response handling**: Update where tool responses are processed to query control plane
2. **Add metadata field**: Extend tool message format to include control plane data
3. **Update recording system**: Ensure metadata is captured in trajectory recordings

**Files to modify**:
- Tool response processing in rollout system
- Message construction in policy classes
- Recording/playback system metadata handling

### **‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY 3: Implement Proper Multi-Environment Termination**
**Goal**: Each environment should stop independently when it reaches terminal states.

**Action Items**:
1. **Per-environment termination tracking**: Track which environments have terminated
2. **Rollout filtering**: Only continue rollout for active environments
3. **Final recording**: Ensure terminated environments get proper final trajectory entries

## üîß **TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**

### **Current Architecture (MOSTLY CORRECT)**
```
Policy ‚Üí Generates lake_move actions ‚Üí Proxy ‚Üí Routes to Backend Server ‚Üí Detects holes/goals ‚Üí Updates control plane ‚Üí MCP Resources
                                                        ‚Üì                                    ‚Üë
Rollout ‚Üê Connection Manager ‚Üê Tool Response (data plane) + Control Plane Query (needs proxy integration) ‚Üê
```

### **What's Working (Multi-Environment)**
- ‚úÖ **Proxy startup**: MultiEnvironmentProxy starts without hanging
- ‚úÖ **Tool discovery**: Tools properly discovered and registered ("lake_move") during eager discovery
- ‚úÖ **Tool routing**: Tool calls are properly routed through proxy (when servers exist)
- ‚úÖ **Policy generation**: Policy generates correct tool calls with proper arguments
- ‚úÖ **Recording initiation**: Trajectory recording starts correctly

### **What's Broken (Multi-Environment)**
- ‚ùå **Backend server startup**: Process manager can't find server.py file (wrong working directory)
- ‚ùå **Session creation**: All backend server instances fail to start
- ‚ùå **Control plane queries**: Resource requests fail due to session creation failures
- ‚ùå **Rollout continuation**: Trajectories stop after step 0 due to control plane failures
- ‚ùå **Tool listing**: Tools not exposed to clients (but tool calls work when servers exist)
- ‚ùå **Termination handling**: No proper per-environment termination logic
- ‚ùå **Metadata capture**: Control plane data not stored in tool message metadata

### **Key Files for Next Engineer**

**Rollout System (PRIMARY FOCUS)**:
- `reward_kit/mcp/execution/rollout.py` - Main rollout logic, likely where single-step issue exists
- `reward_kit/mcp/client/connection.py` - Control plane resource reading through proxy
- `examples/frozen_lake_mcp/tests/test_simple_deterministic_policy.py` - Test that stops after 1 step

**Multi-Environment Proxy (WORKING)**:
- `reward_kit/mcp/multi_environment_proxy.py` - Proxy implementation (startup fixed)
- `reward_kit/mcp/simple_process_manager.py` - Simple process manager (working)

**Control Plane System (NEEDS PROXY INTEGRATION)**:
- `reward_kit/mcp/mcpgym.py` - Control plane resource registration
- Tool message metadata handling (needs implementation)

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION FIXES APPLIED**

### **Recently Completed Fixes**
1. **Fixed multi-environment proxy startup**: Added async executor for process creation
2. **Fixed tool discovery timing**: Set `tools_discovered = True` after successful discovery
3. **Added environment variables for testing**: `FORCE_SIMPLE_PROCESS_MANAGER=true`
4. **Fixed tool call generation**: Policy now finds and uses "lake_move" tool correctly
5. **Improved async compatibility**: Made backend server startup non-blocking

### **Code Changes Made**
- `reward_kit/mcp/multi_environment_proxy.py`: Fixed async startup and tool discovery
- `examples/frozen_lake_mcp/tests/test_simple_deterministic_policy.py`: Added fast testing environment
- `reward_kit/mcp/execution/simple_deterministic_policy.py`: Proper tool name lookup (working)

### **Environment Variables for Testing**
```bash
# For fast multi-environment testing (no conda environments)
export FORCE_SIMPLE_PROCESS_MANAGER=true

# For debugging (enable when needed)
# export SKIP_EAGER_TOOL_DISCOVERY=true
```

## üîç **HANDOFF DEBUGGING GUIDE**

### **Quick Test Commands**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Must run from correct directory
cd examples/frozen_lake_mcp

# Test single environment (should work completely)
pytest -v -s tests/test_simple_deterministic_policy.py::test_deterministic_policy_single_environment

# Test multi-environment (currently hangs after step 0)
pytest -v -s tests/test_simple_deterministic_policy.py::test_deterministic_policy_multi_environment

# Check recorded steps (currently only 3 lines - step 0 for each env)
wc -l tests/recordings/*.jsonl
head -1 tests/recordings/deterministic_policy_trajectory_multi_env.jsonl | python -m json.tool

# Debug proxy startup directly
export FORCE_SIMPLE_PROCESS_MANAGER=true
python -m reward_kit.mcp.multi_environment_proxy --server-script server.py --requirements requirements.txt --port 8095 --max-envs 3
```

### **Key Debugging Areas**
1. **üö® CRITICAL**: Backend server path resolution - process manager can't find server.py
2. **Session creation failures**: All backend servers fail to start with "No such file or directory"
3. **Control plane resource failures**: `control://reward` and `control://status` queries fail
4. **Rollout hanging**: Without control plane data, rollout waits indefinitely after step 0

### **Success Indicators to Look For**
- **First**: Backend servers start successfully (no "No such file or directory" errors)
- **Second**: Session creation works (no "Failed to create session" errors)
- **Third**: Control plane resources return data (not error messages)
- **Fourth**: Recording file has >3 lines (multiple steps per environment)
- **Fifth**: Tool calls remain "lake_move" (not "unknown")

### **Error Patterns to Watch For**
- `STDERR: /home/bchen/home/reward-kit/.venv/bin/python: can't open file '/home/bchen/home/reward-kit/server.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`
- `ERROR: Failed to create session [...]: Could not create environment instance`
- `{"error": "Failed to create session", "session": "[...]"}`

The foundation is partially solid - proxy startup works, but backend server creation is completely broken due to path resolution issues. Once this is fixed, the remaining issues are in control plane integration and rollout continuation.
