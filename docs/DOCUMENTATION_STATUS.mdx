# Documentation Status and TODOs

This document tracks the current status and planned updates for the Reward Kit documentation.
For a detailed breakdown of pending tasks, please refer to `development/DOCS_TODO.md`.

## Overview

The documentation is undergoing a review and update process to reflect recent changes in the codebase, particularly the integration of Hydra for configuration management in examples and CLI commands, and updates to the dataset loading mechanisms.

## Current High-Priority TODOs

The following items are prioritized for immediate attention. See `development/DOCS_TODO.md` for the full list.

1.  **Update `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STATUS.mdx` (This File)**
    *   **Status**: In Progress (this update).
    *   **Goal**: Reflect the new comprehensive TODO list and current priorities.

2.  **Create Hydra Configuration Guide for Examples**
    *   **Status**: Pending.
    *   **Proposed Location**: `docs/developer_guide/hydra_configuration.mdx`
    *   **Goal**: Explain how Hydra is used for configuring and running examples.

3.  **Update Documentation for `reward-kit run` CLI Command**
    *   **Status**: Pending.
    *   **Affected Files**: `docs/cli_reference/cli_overview.mdx`, potentially a new dedicated page.
    *   **Goal**: Document the Hydra-based `reward-kit run` command.

4.  **Update `docs/developer_guide/evaluation_workflows.mdx`**
    *   **Status**: Pending.
    *   **Goal**: Align evaluation workflow documentation with the Hydra-based `reward-kit run` command.

5.  **Update `docs/examples/examples_overview.mdx` and Pilot Example Doc (Math Example)**
    *   **Status**: Pending.
    *   **Goal**: Update the main examples overview and the documentation for `math_example` in `docs/examples/` to reflect current best practices (Hydra, linking to example-specific READMEs).

## General Approach for Updates

*   **Reference `development/DOCS_TODO.md`**: This file contains the master list of tasks.
*   **Consistency**: Ensure consistent terminology and workflow descriptions.
*   **Accuracy**: Verify all examples, commands, and configurations against the current codebase.
*   **Linkages**: Ensure proper cross-referencing between documents.

## Completed Recently

*   **`docs/dataset_configuration_guide.md`**: Created to explain YAML configurations for datasets.
*   **`examples/README.md`**: Created to guide developers on the structure and usage of examples.
*   **`development/DOCS_TODO.md`**: Created to list all documentation tasks.

This document will be updated as tasks from `development/DOCS_TODO.md` are addressed.
