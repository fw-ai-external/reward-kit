# Reward Kit Documentation

Welcome to the Reward Kit documentation. This guide will help you create, test, and deploy reward functions for evaluating and optimizing LLM responses.

## Getting Started

### Developer Guide
- [Getting Started with Reward Functions](developer_guide/getting_started.md): Learn the basics of reward functions
- [Reward Function Anatomy](developer_guide/reward_function_anatomy.md): Understand the structure of reward functions
- [Core Data Types](developer_guide/core_data_types.md): Explore the data models used in reward functions
- [Evaluation Workflows](developer_guide/evaluation_workflows.md): Learn the complete lifecycle from development to deployment

### Examples and Built-in Reward Functions
- [Reward Functions Overview](examples/reward_functions_overview.md): Overview of all built-in reward functions
- [Basic Reward Function](examples/basic_reward_function.md): Simple example evaluating response clarity
- [Advanced Reward Functions](examples/advanced_reward_functions.md): More complex examples with multiple metrics

#### Built-in Reward Function Documentation
- [Code Execution Evaluation](examples/code_execution_evaluation.md): Evaluate code by running it locally
- [Code Execution with E2B](examples/code_execution_with_e2b.md): Evaluate code using E2B cloud sandbox
- [Function Calling Evaluation](examples/function_calling_evaluation.md): Evaluate function calls made by AI models
- [JSON Schema Validation](examples/json_schema_validation.md): Validate JSON outputs against schemas
- [Math Evaluation](examples/math_evaluation.md): Evaluate mathematical answers in responses
