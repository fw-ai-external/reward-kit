# Reward Function Anatomy

This guide provides a detailed explanation of how reward functions are structured in the Reward Kit, focusing on the `@reward_function` decorator and the components that make up a complete reward function.

## The `@reward_function` Decorator

The `@reward_function` decorator is the core mechanism that transforms a regular Python function into a reward function that can be used for evaluation and deployment.

```python
from reward_kit import reward_function, EvaluateResult, MetricResult # Added imports

@reward_function
def my_reward_function(messages, original_messages=None, **kwargs):
    # Your evaluation logic here
    score = 0.75 # Example score
    reason = "Overall evaluation reason for my_reward_function"
    metrics_dict = {"example_metric": MetricResult(score=score, success=True, reason="Metric reason")}
    return EvaluateResult(score=score, reason=reason, metrics=metrics_dict)
```

### What the Decorator Does

The `@reward_function` decorator performs several important functions:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensures the function receives the expected parameters
2. **Output Standardization**: Ensures the function returns a properly formatted `EvaluateResult` object
3. **Deployment Capability**: Adds a `.deploy()` method to the function for easy deployment
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Handles legacy return formats (tuples of score and metrics)

### Under the Hood

Internally, the decorator wraps your function with logic that:

1. Processes the input parameters
2. Calls your function with the standardized inputs
3. Handles any exceptions that occur during execution
4. Formats the output as an `EvaluateResult` object
5. Provides deployment capabilities through the `.deploy()` method

## Function Parameters

A standard reward function has these parameters:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional # Added for type hints
from reward_kit import EvaluateResult # Added for type hints

def reward_function(
    messages: List[Dict[str, str]],
    original_messages: Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]] = None,
    **kwargs
) -> EvaluateResult: # Changed RewardOutput to EvaluateResult
    # ...
    pass # Added pass for valid syntax
```

### Required Parameters

- **`messages`**: A list of message dictionaries in the conversation, where each message has at least `"role"` and `"content"` keys. The last message is typically the one being evaluated.

### Optional Parameters

- **`original_messages`**: The conversation context, usually messages before the response being evaluated. If not provided, it defaults to `messages[:-1]`.
- **`**kwargs`**: Additional parameters that can be used to customize the evaluation.

## Return Value

A reward function must return an `EvaluateResult` object:

```python
from reward_kit import EvaluateResult, MetricResult # Added imports

# score, clarity_score, accuracy_score would be calculated by your logic
clarity_score = 0.8
accuracy_score = 0.7
final_score = 0.75

return EvaluateResult(
    score=final_score,  # Overall score between 0.0 and 1.0
    reason="Overall evaluation based on clarity and accuracy.", # Added reason
    metrics={    # Component metrics
        "clarity": MetricResult( # Changed MetricRewardOutput to MetricResult
            score=clarity_score,
            success=clarity_score >= 0.7, # Added success
            reason="The response clearly explains the concept"
        ),
        "accuracy": MetricResult( # Changed MetricRewardOutput to MetricResult
            score=accuracy_score,
            success=accuracy_score >= 0.6, # Added success
            reason="Contains one minor factual error"
        )
    }
)
```

### EvaluateResult Structure

- **`score`**: The final aggregate score (typically between 0.0 and 1.0).
- **`reason`**: An optional top-level explanation for the overall score.
- **`metrics`**: A dictionary of component metrics (`MetricResult` objects), each with its own score, success flag, and explanation.
- **`error`**: An optional string field to convey errors during evaluation.


## Multi-Component Reward Functions

Complex reward functions often evaluate multiple aspects of a response:

```python
from reward_kit import reward_function, EvaluateResult, MetricResult # Added imports
from typing import List, Dict, Optional # Added for type hints

# Assume evaluate_clarity and evaluate_accuracy are defined elsewhere
def evaluate_clarity(response: str) -> float: return 0.8
def evaluate_accuracy(response: str) -> float: return 0.6


@reward_function
def comprehensive_evaluation(
    messages: List[Dict[str, str]], # Added type hints
    original_messages: Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]] = None, # Added type hints
    **kwargs
) -> EvaluateResult: # Changed RewardOutput to EvaluateResult
    response = messages[-1]["content"]
    metrics = {}

    # Evaluate clarity
    clarity_score = evaluate_clarity(response)
    metrics["clarity"] = MetricResult( # Changed MetricRewardOutput to MetricResult
        score=clarity_score,
        success=clarity_score >= 0.7, # Added success
        reason=f"Clarity score: {clarity_score:.2f}"
    )

    # Evaluate accuracy
    accuracy_score = evaluate_accuracy(response)
    metrics["accuracy"] = MetricResult( # Changed MetricRewardOutput to MetricResult
        score=accuracy_score,
        success=accuracy_score >= 0.6, # Added success
        reason=f"Accuracy score: {accuracy_score:.2f}"
    )

    # Combine scores (weighted average)
    final_score = clarity_score * 0.4 + accuracy_score * 0.6

    return EvaluateResult(score=final_score, reason="Comprehensive evaluation complete.", metrics=metrics) # Changed RewardOutput
```

## Deployment Capabilities

The `@reward_function` decorator adds a `.deploy()` method to your function:

```python
# Assume my_reward_function is defined as above
# Deploy the function to Fireworks
evaluation_id = my_reward_function.deploy(
    name="my-evaluator",
    description="Evaluates responses based on custom criteria",
    force=True  # Overwrite if already exists
)
```

### Deploy Method Parameters

- **`name`**: ID for the deployed evaluator (required)
- **`description`**: Human-readable description (optional)
- **`force`**: Whether to overwrite an existing evaluator with the same name (optional)
- **`providers`**: List of model providers to use for evaluation (optional)

## Error Handling

Robust reward functions include proper error handling:

```python
from reward_kit import reward_function, EvaluateResult, MetricResult # Added imports
from typing import List, Dict, Optional # Added for type hints

@reward_function
def safe_evaluation(
    messages: List[Dict[str, str]], # Added type hints
    original_messages: Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]] = None, # Added type hints
    **kwargs
) -> EvaluateResult: # Changed RewardOutput to EvaluateResult
    try:
        # Ensure we have a valid response to evaluate
        if not messages or messages[-1].get("role") != "assistant":
            return EvaluateResult( # Changed RewardOutput
                score=0.0,
                reason="No assistant response found.", # Added reason
                metrics={"error": MetricResult( # Changed MetricRewardOutput
                    score=0.0,
                    success=False, # Added success
                    reason="No assistant response found"
                )}
            )

        # Your evaluation logic here
        # ...
        # For example:
        calculated_score = 0.0 # Placeholder for actual logic
        if calculated_score == 0 : raise ValueError("Simulated error")
        return EvaluateResult(score=1.0, reason="Successful evaluation", metrics={})


    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any unexpected errors
        return EvaluateResult( # Changed RewardOutput
            score=0.0,
            reason=f"Evaluation error: {str(e)}", # Added reason
            metrics={"error": MetricResult( # Changed MetricRewardOutput
                score=0.0,
                success=False, # Added success
                reason=f"Evaluation error: {str(e)}"
            )}
        )
```

## Working with Metadata

You can pass additional configuration through the `**kwargs` parameter, often via a `metadata` dictionary.

```python
from reward_kit import reward_function, EvaluateResult, MetricResult # Added imports
from typing import List, Dict, Optional, Any # Added Any for metadata type hint

# Assume base_score and metrics are calculated based on messages
def calculate_base_score_and_metrics(response_content: str, min_length: int) -> tuple[float, dict]:
    # Dummy implementation
    current_length = len(response_content)
    score = 1.0 if current_length >= min_length else 0.5
    return score, {"length_check": MetricResult(score=score, success=current_length >= min_length, reason=f"Length {current_length} vs min {min_length}")}

@reward_function
def configurable_evaluation(
    messages: List[Dict[str, str]], # Added type hints
    original_messages: Optional[List[Dict[str, str]]] = None, # Added type hints
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, 
    **kwargs
) -> EvaluateResult: # Changed RewardOutput to EvaluateResult
    """Reward function that supports configuration via metadata."""
    metadata = metadata or {}
    response_content = messages[-1].get("content", "")

    # Get configurable thresholds from metadata
    min_length = metadata.get("min_length", 50)
    max_score_cap = metadata.get("max_score_cap", 1.0) # Renamed to avoid conflict with 'score'
    weight_factor = metadata.get("weight_factor", 1.0)

    # Use these parameters in your evaluation
    base_score, metrics = calculate_base_score_and_metrics(response_content, min_length)

    # Apply any metadata-based adjustments to the final score
    final_score = base_score * weight_factor
    final_score = min(final_score, max_score_cap) # Cap the score

    return EvaluateResult(score=final_score, reason="Configurable evaluation complete.", metrics=metrics) # Changed RewardOutput
```

When calling the function, you can pass this metadata:

```python
# Assume test_messages is defined
# result = configurable_evaluation(
#     messages=test_messages,
#     metadata={"min_length": 100, "weight_factor": 1.2}
# )
```
