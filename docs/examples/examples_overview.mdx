# Reward Kit Examples

This page provides an overview of and links to documentation for various examples demonstrating the capabilities of the Reward Kit. All documentation for these examples is self-contained within the `docs/` folder.

Many examples use [Hydra for configuration](../developer_guide/hydra_configuration.mdx). Please refer to the specific documentation page for each example for execution instructions.

## Available Examples

*   **Accuracy Length Example**:
    *   Demonstrates combined accuracy and length rewards.
