# Math with Format and Length Example

This example combines the ideas from the basic Math Example and the Math with Formatting
Example. In addition to checking numerical accuracy and the presence of
`<think>...</think><answer>...</answer>` formatting, it also rewards shorter correct
responses using a cosine-based length penalty.

The configuration file is `examples/math_with_format_and_length/conf/simple_math_format_length_eval.yaml`.
Run it with:
```bash
python -m reward_kit.cli run --config-path examples/math_with_format_and_length/conf --config-name simple_math_format_length_eval
```
