{"assistant_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem says a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. I need to find the total number of bolts required. Hmm, so first, I should figure out how much white fiber is needed. The blue fiber is 2 bolts, and the white is half that much. So half of 2 bolts would be... 1 bolt? Wait, yes, because half of 2 is 1. So white fiber is 1 bolt. \n\nThen, to get the total bolts, I just add the blue and white together. That would be 2 + 1. Which equals 3. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. If half the amount of white fiber as blue, so blue is 2, white is 2 divided by 2, which is 1. Total is 2 + 1 = 3. Yeah, that makes sense. So the total bolts needed are 3. I think that's the answer. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the problem again. \n\n\"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. How many bolts in total does it take?\" No, it seems like it's just two components: blue and white. The white is half the amount of blue. So 2 blue, 1 white. Total 3. \n\nI guess another way to think about it is, if \"half that much\" refers to half of the blue fiber amount. So yes, half of 2 is 1. So white is 1. Total is 2 + 1 = 3. \n\nI don't see any other way to interpret this. The problem seems simple, but sometimes wording can trip you up. Let me parse the wording again. \"Half that much white fiber\"\u2014 \"that much\" refers to the amount of blue fiber. So half of 2 bolts. Yep, that's 1. So total bolts = 2 + 1 = 3. \n\nI think that's correct. Unless there's some hidden step or consideration, but I don't see it. The problem doesn't mention any other materials or factors. Just blue and white fibers. So 3 bolts total. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe total number of bolts needed is <answer>3</answer>.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the total number of bolts required to make a robe, we start by analyzing the given information:\n\n- The robe requires **2 bolts of blue fiber**.\n- The amount of **white fiber** needed is **half that of the blue fiber**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the amount of white fiber\nSince the white fiber is half the amount of blue fiber:\n\n$$\n\\text{White fiber} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ bolt}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total number of bolts\nNow, we add the blue and white fibers together:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total bolts} = 2 \\text{ (blue)} + 1 \\text{ (white)} = 3 \\text{ bolts}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$"}
