# GSM8K dataset with math-specific system prompt for evaluation.
# This derived dataset takes the base GSM8K dataset and adds a system prompt
# for math problem solving, converting it to evaluation format.

defaults:
  - base_derived_dataset
  - _self_

# Reference the base GSM8K dataset
base_dataset: "gsm8k"

# Math-specific system prompt
system_prompt: "Solve the following math problem. Provide your reasoning and then put the final numerical answer between <answer> and </answer> tags."

# Convert to evaluation format with user_query and ground_truth_for_eval
output_format: "evaluation_format"

# Column mapping to rename GSM8K columns to expected format
# GSM8K has 'question' and 'answer', but we need 'query' and 'ground_truth'
derived_column_mapping:
  query: "question"
  ground_truth: "answer"

# For testing, limit to a small number of samples
derived_max_samples: 5
