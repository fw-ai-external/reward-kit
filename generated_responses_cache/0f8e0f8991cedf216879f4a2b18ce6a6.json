{"assistant_response": "Let's break this down step by step.\n\nSince both trains travel the same distance in the same direction on the first day, we can say that each train covers 80 miles on the first day.\n\nOn the second day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. Since they are traveling in the same direction (north), we can say that each train covers 150 miles on the second day.\n\nTo find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we simply add the distances covered on each day:\n\nTrain 1: 80 miles (Day 1) + 150 miles (Day 2) = 230 miles\nTrain 2: 80 miles (Day 1) + 150 miles (Day 2) = 230 miles\n\nSo, the distance covered by each train in the two days is 230 miles.\n\n<answer>230</answer>"}
