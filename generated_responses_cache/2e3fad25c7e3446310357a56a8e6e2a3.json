{"assistant_response": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with \"x\". Then, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners at the green house.\n\n2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green and red houses is x/3 + 2.\n\n3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. What was left after selling at the green and red houses is x - (x/3 + 2). Half of this is (x - (x/3 + 2))/2.\n\n4. We know that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means that the total number of vacuum cleaners she sold is x - 5.\n\n5. We can set up an equation using the information from steps 2 and 4:\n\nx - (x/3 + 2) = x - 5\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nx - x/3 - 2 = x - 5\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(2x/3) - 2 = x - 5\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\n2x/3 = x - 3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n2x = 3x - 9\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides:\n\n-x = -9\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nx = 9\n\nSo, Melanie started with 9 vacuum cleaners.\n\n<answer>9</answer>"}
