{"assistant_response": "To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to first find out the total number of cups of feed she gives to her chickens in a day.\n\nIn the morning, she gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed she gives in the morning and afternoon is:\n15 + 25 = 40 cups\n\nSince each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per meal, and Wendi has 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed she needs to give to her chickens in a day is:\n20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups\n\nSince she has already given her chickens 40 cups of feed in the morning and afternoon, she needs to give them the remaining cups of feed in the final meal of the day:\n60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups\n\n<answer>20</answer>"}
