{"assistant_response": "To find out how many eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total number of eggs she eats in a week and then multiply it by 4.\n\nSince Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs per day.\n\nThere are 7 days in a week, so she eats 3 eggs/day x 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.\n\nIn 4 weeks, she will eat 21 eggs/week x 4 weeks = 84 eggs.\n\nSince there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs she will eat:\n\n84 eggs \u00f7 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens\n\n<answer>7</answer>"}
