{"assistant_response": "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.\n3. She bakes muffins with 4 eggs, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.\n4. She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.\n\nTo find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells (9) by the price per egg ($2):\n\n9 eggs x $2/egg = $18\n\nSo, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\n<answer>$18</answer>"}
