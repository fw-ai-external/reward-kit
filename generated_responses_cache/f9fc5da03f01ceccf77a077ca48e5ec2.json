{"assistant_response": "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses.\n2. One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs 60% of the price, which is $5 x 0.6 = $3.\n3. Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, we can divide them into two groups: the first 8 glasses and the second 8 glasses.\n4. The first 8 glasses will cost $5 each, so the total cost for these glasses is 8 x $5 = $40.\n5. The second 8 glasses will cost $3 each, so the total cost for these glasses is 8 x $3 = $24.\n6. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the first 8 glasses and the second 8 glasses: $40 + $24 = $64.\n\nSo, Kylar needs to pay <answer>64</answer> dollars for the glasses."}
