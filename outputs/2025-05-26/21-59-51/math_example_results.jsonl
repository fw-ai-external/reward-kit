She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.\n3. She bakes muffins with 4 eggs, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.\n4. She sells the remaining 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.\n\nTo find out how much she makes, we multiply the number of eggs she sells (9) by the price per egg ($2):\n\n9 eggs x $2/egg = $18\n\nSo, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\n<answer>$18</answer>", "ground_truth_for_eval": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18", "evaluation_score": 1.0, "evaluation_reason": "Best match: Gen='<answer>$18</answer>' (18.0) vs Orig='#### 18' (18.0).\nNumeric match: Yes, Similarity: 1.000", "evaluation_metrics": {"extracted_original_answers": {"is_score_valid": true, "score": 0.0, "reason": "Extracted from original: '#### 18' (18.0)"}, "extracted_generated_answers": {"is_score_valid": true, "score": 0.0, "reason": "Extracted from generated (initial): '<answer>$18</answer>' (18.0)"}, "answer_comparison": {"is_score_valid": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "Best match: Gen='<answer>$18</answer>' (18.0) vs Orig='#### 18' (18.0).\nNumeric match: Yes, Similarity: 1.000"}}}
