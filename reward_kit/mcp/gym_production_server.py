GymProductionServer Framework

This framework provides a base class for creating MCP servers that wrap gymnasium
environments using adapters. It handles:

1. Multi-session and single-session server lifecycle
2. Automatic tool and resource registration
3. Environment management via adapters
4. MCP resource patterns for initial state
5. Standardized tool signatures
6. Session management with proper seed extraction

Usage:
    class MyGameProdServer(GymProductionServer):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__("MyGame-v1", MyAdapter())

        def _register_tools(self):
            # Register domain-specific tools

        @staticmethod
        def format_observation(obs, env):
            # Format observations for MCP responses
